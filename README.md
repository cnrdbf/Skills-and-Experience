# Skills and Experience
Other skills and experience I have acquired over the years comes from a lot throguh the jobs I have had and the sports I have participated in. Over the years I have played many sports such as:
- Football
- Basketball
- Baseball
- Track & Field
- Swimming
Throught these sports and events I have learned what it takes to be a leader, a listener, and a team player through the adversity I have faced through the sport and the bonds I made with my teammates.

I have also worked a job at the Forum 8 Movie Theater and now work at <a href="https://www.themizzoustore.com/t-tigertech.aspx">TigerTech</a> in the Mizzou Store. Through both these jobs I have developed good problem-solving skills and learned how to work hard under pressure. Using these skills is why I believe I will perform well in the IT field.
